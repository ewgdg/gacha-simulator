          Luckily, you just happened to know a friend who can help you. You
          friend promise you that he will collect some data and secret
          information for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some information are given to you for free, but some secret
          information has a price.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to observe these data and solve the mechanism behind the
          black box. You would notice some patterns and you need to utilize
          these patterns to achieve your goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carefully decide if you are going to buy the secrets or not, because
          they are not cheap and the cost will be added to your total spending,
          which will affect your final score.
