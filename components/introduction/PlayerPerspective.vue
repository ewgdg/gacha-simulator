          In this gacha simulation game, you pretend to be a big fan of
          Skinnerian Gaming, and your goal is to collect those unique
          collectibles as much as possible, by pruchasing some kind of loot
          boxes from Skinnerian Gaming, with least amount of spending.
        </p>
        <p>
          However it is not that easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the company reveals the general odds of receiving these goods
          of different rarity levels, the details mechanism remains a black box
          to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example you don't know if the probability is uniformly distributed
          for those unique items belong to same rarity level or not.
