          The game has a time span of 30 days. By clicking the 'day >>' button
          on the toolbar you can goto next day. Notice that you can terminate
          the game anytime you want by click the 'end' button on the top right
          corner, and your score for the days you played will be evaluated
          immediately. Sometime it is a good strategy to terminate the game
          early for better performance. The time factor might affect how the
          score is calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of this game, you will receive a final score based on your
          performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your performance will be evaluated based on 2 factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Player total amount of spending</li>
          <li>Collection rate (rarer items are weighted more)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now, start the game by clicking the play button.
